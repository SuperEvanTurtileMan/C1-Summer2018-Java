# Tutorial Course C1 Summer2018
## Introduction to Computer Science - Learning Java

Welcome to the C1 Summer 2018 Tutorial Course. You will be learning the essentials of the Java language, and much more! This tutorial course is recommended for beginners, and those who are thirsty for a bit more challenge. Read a bit more and you'll find out why!

For the first time ever, I will be offering three different sections to this course - C1A, C1B, and C1F. What is different about each one?

### C1A - For Beginners
Tutorial Course C1A is recommended to those who want to begin learning the essentials of the Java language. Newcomers will be taught simple programming in the Java language - that includes printing, handling values and assigning them to variables, if statements, loops, and objects. The topics in this particular tutorial section are easy and provide a gateway to understanding more complex situations in the Java language.

### C1B - For Intermediate Coders!
Tutorial Course C1B is recommended to those who have already taken tutorial course C1A (the older variations of it in the past) or those who understand how to code in the Java language but want to be exposed to complex logic that can be used in bigger projects. If you fall into this camp, then you will be able to whet your appetite in learning how to code bigger and better things in Java! Of course, I'll start off small so that I can help push you in the right direction.

### C1F - For Those Who Want The Full Package!
Tutorial Course C1F is recommended to those who want to learn the Java language and be able to code some awesome things. If you enroll into this particular section, you will have the full package: learning the essentials of the Java language in the first half of the course and then learning a bit more complex stuff - things like handling data in linked lists and more - in the second half of the course utilizing the Java language.

Stay tuned for more information on the actual course website! There, you will be able to view the schedule.

##Tutorial Courses C1A and the first half of C1F will start on Saturday, June 16, 2018.
##Tutorial Courses C1B and the second half of C1F will start on July 24, 2018.
